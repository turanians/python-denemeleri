🌌 3D Young's Double Slit Experiment Simulation
This project is a software that simulates Young's Double Slit Experiment, one of the fundamental building blocks of quantum mechanics and wave optics, in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. Unlike traditional 2D representations, it visualizes wave interference, phase differences, and the physics of an inclined screen in a dynamic 3D space.

🚀 Features
3D Visualization: Examine the relationship between wave sources, slits, and the observation screen in a 3D space.

Inclined Screen Analysis: Observe distortions and changes in diffraction and interference patterns based on the tilt angle of the screen.

Dynamic Parameters: Manipulate critical physical variables such as wavelength, distance between slits, and screen distance in real time.

Multi-Platform Support:

Python (VPython / PyQt5) infrastructure for desktop analysis.

Three.js integration for web-based access.

🛠️ Built With
The project is developed using the following technologies to achieve high-performance 3D rendering on both desktop and web platforms:

Python 3.x

VPython / PyQt5 (Desktop 3D Graphics & GUI)

Three.js / JavaScript (Web-based 3D Modeling)

HTML5 & CSS3

📦 Getting Started
Desktop Version (Python)
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/3d-double-slit-simulation.git
cd 3d-double-slit-simulation

Install the required libraries:
pip install vpython PyQt5

Run the simulation:
python main.py

Web Version (Three.js)
To run the web version without any installation, simply open the index.html file in your browser or start the project using a local server (e.g., Live Server).

🔬 Mathematical Background
Interference pattern calculations in the simulation are based on classical wave mechanics formulas, relying on the wave characteristics of light and the path difference:

Path Difference: The difference in distance from the slits to any given point on the screen.

Interference Conditions:

Bright Fringes (Maxima): d * sin(theta) = m * lambda

Dark Fringes (Minima): d * sin(theta) = (m + 1/2) * lambda

In the case of an inclined screen, the actual 3D distance from each pixel to the wave sources is dynamically calculated using the screen's rotation matrix.
